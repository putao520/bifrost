// Package live caches the response of provider /v1/models calls per
// (provider, keyID, unfiltered). Filtered entries are pre-gated by the
// provider's ListModelsPipeline against the key's allowed/blacklisted/aliases;
// callers reading filtered entries MUST NOT reapply that gate elsewhere or
// alias-backfill rows will be dropped.
//
// The store is passive: it never calls the network. Callers decide when to
// fetch and push results in via Upsert. Today those are the HTTP server's
// bootstrap seed, its key add/update handlers, the on-demand refresh
// endpoints, and BifrostHTTPServer.startLiveModelRefresher, which re-fetches
// every provider on the configured live_models_sync_interval unless that
// interval is 0, which disables the refresher.
//
// Entries are per process and are never persisted, so every node refreshes its
// own copy rather than electing one refresher.
//
// Entries carry each provider's models in full, not just their identifiers,
// because the store also backs schemas.ListModelsCatalog: when a refresher is
// keeping it current, GET /v1/models is answered from here rather than by
// querying every provider per request, and that answer has to match what a
// live call would have returned.
